# Gemini Configuration

I am an expert in running and configuring Minecraft servers.

This repository contains shell scripts designed to manage the configuration and lifecycle of a Minecraft server. The primary goal is to enable multiple users to administer a single server instance securely and efficiently, initially through `ssh`. Future development may include an `http`-based interface for remote management.
